WEBSITE FOR The Monkees BAND
This is a static (front-end only) website for a band. For wireframes, I have used pen and paper. Assets are taken from the GitHub repo
and also from the free images websites.
The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. 
I have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, 
and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

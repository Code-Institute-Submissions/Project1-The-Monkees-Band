# The Monkees Band 
_Full Stack Software Developer - Century College_
This is a static (front-end only) website for the Monkees Band. 

The band is a [1960s] rock band and has been around for 50 years with experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. 
I have been given the following requirements after interviews with the clientâ€™s representatives:
- The Monkees primary target audiences are their fans 
- Fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, or any new material as it becomes available can do so.
- the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicize their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
In my website, I have YouTube videos, articles, and posters for the Monkees band. On Fan page, I have a form where the user can order videos. On news page, I have all the current news for the Monkees. I have videos for Christmas and weddings, and the latest news for their next events for the wedding or Christmas.
From my website, the user will be inspired to buy more videos and, at the same time, they will get all the latest news.

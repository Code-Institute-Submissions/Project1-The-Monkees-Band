_Full Stack Software Developer - Century College_


### This is a static (front-end only) website for the Monkees Band. 
### For wireframes, I have used pen and paper. Assets are taken from the GitHub repo
### and also from the free images websites.
### The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. 
### I have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:

## UX
* Their primary target audiences are their fans 
* potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, 
* any new material as it becomes available.
* the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
